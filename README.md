# **ImageGallery**

## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Gallery React web application! It is a simple application which 
connects to the Pexels API from www.pexels.com which is a website that hosts free photos 
and videos uploaded by various people. This is a simple project I made to try my hand on 
creating an intuitive React web application that is hosted on vercel with a simple functionality.

## Using the web application

To use the application without downloading the source code and running it on the
local machine, simply navigate to https://image-gallery-six.vercel.app/ and check it out! :)

### Prerequisites for running on local machine

1. npm package manager installed on local machine
2. Pexels account and API authentication key

### Running the application on the local machine

1. Pull the git project to a directory of your choosing
2. Navigate to the web-app directory where you have downloaded the source code
3. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies for the project
4. Create an `.env` file inside the web-app directory and set your Pexels API authentication key as 
`REACT_APP_PEXELS_AUTH=[your_auth_key]`
5. Run `npm start` to start the web application 
6. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your favorite web browser
7. Use the application to your heart's content! :)
