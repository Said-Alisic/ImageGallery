# ImageGallery

## Introduction

Welcome to the Image Gallery React web application! It is a simple application which 
connects to the Pexels API from www.pexels.com which is a website that hosts free photos 
and videos uploaded by various people. This is a simple project I made to try my hand on 
creating an intuitive React web application that is hosted on vercel with a simple functionality.
